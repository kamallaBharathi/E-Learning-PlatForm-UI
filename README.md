DESCRIPTION:The primary objective of this task is to create a styled, multi-page E-Learning platform UI. The interface should include essential features such as course listings, user progress tracking, and support for embedded video content. The deliverable must demonstrate an understanding of web structure, layout, interactivity.This page should provide a clean and engaging introduction to the platform, featuring navigation links to key sections like Courses, My Progress, About Us, and Contact. Interns are encouraged to use semantic HTML tags and a responsive layout to ensure the website looks appealing.One of the key elements of this project is the Course Listing Page. This section should present multiple courses with clear titles, thumbnails, descriptions, and possibly categorization or filtering options. Each course card or tile should be well-organized and visually appealing. Interns can add a “View Course” button that navigates to a detailed course page, where embedded video lessons and additional content are displayed.Another important feature is the Progress Tracking section. This should reflect the user’s learning progress, either through a progress bar, percentage indicators, or a checklist of completed modules. While the progress data doesn’t have to be dynamic or back-end powered, the interface should demonstrate how such a feature would look and behave.The inclusion of embedded videos on course pages is another crucial aspect.should integrate sample video content using the by embedding YouTube videos. These videos should be styled neatly and fit well within the layout, maintaining consistency across various screen sizes.allowing users to move between pages like Home, Courses, and Progress without confusion.Successful completion will BE showcase-worthy portfolio work.
